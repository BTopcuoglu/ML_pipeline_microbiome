# development version 0.1.0

- mikropml now has a logo created by @NLesniak!
- Made documentation improvements (#238, #231, @kelly-sovacool).
- New option in `preprocess_data()`: `prefilter_threshold` (#240, @kelly-sovacool, @courtneyarmour).
    - Remove any features that appear in N=`prefilter_threshold` or fewer rows in the data.
    - Created function `remove_singleton_columns()` called by `preprocess_data()` to carry this out.
- New option in `get_feature_importance()`: `groups` (#246, @kelly-sovacool).
    - Provide custom groups of features to permute together during permutation importance.
    - `groups` is `NULL` by default; in this case, correlated features above `corr_thresh` are grouped together.
- `preprocess_data()` now replaces spaces in the outcome column with underscores (#247, @kelly-sovacool, @JohnnyTran).
- Clarify in the intro vignette that we do not support multi-label outcomes. (#254, @zenalapp)

# mikropml 0.0.2

- Fixed a test failure on Solaris.
- Fixed multiple test failtures with R 3.6.2 due to `stringsAsFactors` behavior.
- Made minor documentation improvements.
- Moved `rpart` from Suggests to Imports for consistency with other packages used during model training.
