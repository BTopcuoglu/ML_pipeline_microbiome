	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The overall age-standardized cancer incidence rate continues to decline whereas the number of cases diagnosed each year increases. Predicting cancer incidence can help to anticipate future resource needs, evaluate primary prevention strategies, and inform research.
{METHODS}: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were used to estimate the number of cancers (all sites) resulting from changes in population risk, age, and size. The authors projected to 2020 nationwide age-standardized incidence rates and cases (including the top 23 cancers).
{RESULTS}: Since 1975, incident cases increased among white individuals, primarily caused by an aging white population, and among black individuals, primarily caused by an increasing black population. Between 2010 and 2020, it is expected that overall incidence rates (proxy for risk) will decrease slightly among black men and stabilize in other groups. By 2020, the authors predict annual cancer cases (all races, all sites) to increase among men by 24.1\% (-3.2\% risk and 27.3\% age/growth) to {\textgreater}1 million cases, and by 20.6\% among women (1.2\% risk and 19.4\% age/growth) to {\textgreater}900,000 cases. The largest increases are expected for melanoma (white individuals); cancers of the prostate, kidney, liver, and urinary bladder in males; and the lung, breast, uterus, and thyroid in females.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, the authors predict cancer incidence rates/risk to stabilize for the majority of the population; however, they expect the number of cancer cases to increase by {\textgreater}20\%. A greater emphasis on primary prevention and early detection is needed to counter the effect of an aging and growing population on the burden of cancer.},

Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater than 90Â \% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota associated with the progression of {CRC}, suggesting that the gut microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test ({FIT}).},

	abstract = {Background
There is a significant demand for colorectal cancer ({CRC}) screening methods that are noninvasive, inexpensive, and capable of accurately detecting early stage tumors. It has been shown that models based on the gut microbiota can complement the fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test ({FIT}). However, a barrier to microbiota-based screening is the need to collect and store a patientâs stool sample.

Results
Using stool samples collected from 404 patients, we tested whether the residual buffer containing resuspended feces in {FIT} cartridges could be used in place of intact stool samples. We found that the bacterial {DNA} isolated from {FIT} cartridges largely recapitulated the community structure and membership of patientsâ stool microbiota and that the abundance of bacteria associated with {CRC} were conserved. We also found that models for detecting {CRC} that were generated using bacterial abundances from {FIT} cartridges were equally predictive as models generated using bacterial abundances from stool.

Conclusions
These findings demonstrate the potential for using residual buffer from {FIT} cartridges in place of stool for microbiota-based screening for {CRC}. This may reduce the need to collect and process separate stool samples and may facilitate combining {FIT} and microbiota-based biomarkers into a single test. Additionally, {FIT} cartridges could constitute a novel data source for studying the role of the microbiome in cancer and other diseases.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may be an important factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Abnormalities in the gut microbiome have been reported in patients with colorectal cancer; however, this microbial community has not been explored as a potential screen for early-stage disease. We characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal cancer (e.g., {BMI}, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17\% and, after using the microbiome data, this increased to 10.67\% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma). Taken together, the results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using the composition of the gut microbiome to detect the presence of precancerous and cancerous lesions. Furthermore, these results support the need for more cross-sectional studies with diverse populations and linkage to other stool markers, dietary data, and personal health information.

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.2584},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.
METHODS: When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads.
RESULTS: VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0.
DISCUSSION: VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.},

	abstract = {Assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a computational bottleneck in the process of analyzing microbial communities. Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5\% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications. IMPORTANCE The analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing has expanded our knowledge of the biogeography of microorganisms. An important step in this analysis is the assignment of sequences into taxonomic groups based on their similarity to sequences in a database or based on their similarity to each other, irrespective of a database. In this study, we present a new algorithm for the latter approach. The algorithm, OptiClust, seeks to optimize a metric of assignment quality by shuffling sequences between taxonomic groups. We found that OptiClust produces more robust assignments and does so in a rapid and memory-efficient manner. This advance will allow for a more robust analysis of microbial communities and the factors that shape them.},

Previous analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host health and disease status, genotype and diet. Here, we developed a method of predicting biological age of the host based on the microbiological profiles of gut microbiota using a curated dataset of 1,165 healthy individuals (3,663 microbiome samples). Our predictive model, a human microbiome clock, has an architecture of a deep neural network and achieves the accuracy of 3.94 years mean absolute error in cross-validation. The performance of the deep microbiome clock was also evaluated on several additional populations. We further introduce a platform for biological interpretation of individual microbial features used in age models, which relies on permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects. This approach has allowed us to define two lists of 95 intestinal biomarkers of human aging. We further show that this list can be reduced to 39 taxa that convey the most information on their host’s aging. Overall, we show that (a) microbiological profiles can be used to predict human age; and (b) microbial features selected by models are age-related.},

    	abstract = {Background: Convolutional Neural Networks can be effectively used only when data are endowed with an intrinsic concept of neighbourhood in the input space, as is the case of pixels in images. We introduce here Ph-{CNN}, a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of metagenomics data based on the Convolutional Neural Networks, with the patristic distance defined on the phylogenetic tree being used as the proximity measure. The patristic distance between variables is used together with a sparsified version of {MultiDimensional} Scaling to embed the phylogenetic tree in a Euclidean space. Results: Ph-{CNN} is tested with a domain adaptation approach on synthetic data and on a metagenomics collection of gut microbiota of 38 healthy subjects and 222 Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, divided in 6 subclasses. Classification performance is promising when compared to classical algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest and a baseline fully connected neural network, e.g. the Multi-Layer Perceptron. Conclusion: Ph-{CNN} represents a novel deep learning approach for the classification of metagenomics data. Operatively, the algorithm has been implemented as a custom Keras layer taking care of passing to the following convolutional layer not only the data but also the ranked list of neighbourhood of each sample, thus mimicking the case of image data, transparently to the user.

    distinguished {CRC} patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants.
    Accuracy of metagenomic {CRC} detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test ({FOBT}) and
    when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved {\textgreater} 45\% relative to the {FOBT},
    while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic {CRC} detection did not differ
    significantly between early- and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and
    control populations (N = 335) from different countries. {CRC}-associated
    changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the
    tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related
    host–microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in
    controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in {CRC} patients, accompanied by an
    increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.},

    	abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions. However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the “healthy” microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml., The human microbiome–the entire set of microbial organisms associated with the human host–interacts closely with host immune and metabolic functions and is crucial for human health. Significant advances in the characterization of the microbiome associated with healthy and diseased individuals have been obtained through next-generation {DNA} sequencing technologies, which permit accurate estimation of microbial communities directly from uncultured human-associated samples (e.g., stool). In particular, shotgun metagenomics provide data at unprecedented species- and strain- levels of resolution. Several large-scale metagenomic disease-associated datasets are also becoming available, and disease-predictive models built on metagenomic signatures have been proposed. However, the generalization of resulting prediction models on different cohorts and diseases has not been validated. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of microbiome-phenotype associations. We consider 2424 samples from eight studies and six different diseases to assess the independent prediction accuracy of models built on shotgun metagenomic data and to compare strategies for practical use of the microbiome as a prediction tool.},

    	abstract = {Background: Adenomatous polyps are the most common precursor to colorectal cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. We sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas.
    Methods: We analyzed 16S {rRNA} gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of patients with adenomas (n = 233) and without (n = 547).
    Results: Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, proinflammatory bacteria in the genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia), and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Our findings were consistent with previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of colorectal cancer patients. Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and phenylpropanoid metabolism.
    Conclusions: These data hint that increased sugar, protein, and lipid metabolism along with increased bile acid production could promote a colonic environment that supports the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and Desulfovibrio. In turn, these microbes may produce genotoxic or inflammatory metabolites such as H2S and secondary bile acids, which could play a role in catalyzing adenoma development and eventually colorectal cancer.
    Impact: This study suggests a plausible biological mechanism to explain the links between shifts in the microbiota and colorectal cancer. This represents a first step toward resolving the complex interactions that shape the adenoma–carcinoma sequence of colorectal cancer and may facilitate personalized therapeutics focused on the microbiota.

    	abstract = {Two recent studies have reanalyzed previously published data and found that when data sets were analyzed independently, there was limited support for the widely accepted hypothesis that changes in the microbiome are associated with obesity. This hypothesis was reconsidered by increasing the number of data sets and pooling the results across the individual data sets. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were used to identify 10 studies for an updated and more synthetic analysis. Alpha diversity metrics and the relative risk of obesity based on those metrics were used to identify a limited number of signiﬁcant associations with obesity; however, when the results of the studies were pooled by using a random-effect model, signiﬁcant associations were observed among Shannon diversity, the number of observed operational taxonomic units, Shannon evenness, and obesity status. They were not observed for the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes or their individual relative abundances. Although these tests yielded small P values, the difference between the Shannon diversity indices of nonobese and obese individuals was 2.07\%. A power analysis demonstrated that only one of the studies had sufﬁcient power to detect a 5\% difference in diversity. When random forest machine learning models were trained on one data set and then tested by using the other nine data sets, the median accuracy varied between 33.01 and 64.77\% (median, 56.68\%). Although there was support for a relationship between the microbial communities found in human feces and obesity status, this association was relatively weak and its detection is confounded by large interpersonal variation and insufﬁcient sample sizes. {IMPORTANCE} As interest in the human microbiome grows, there is an increasing number of studies that can be used to test numerous hypotheses across human populations. The hypothesis that variation in the gut microbiota can explain or be used to predict obesity status has received considerable attention and is frequently mentioned as an example of the role of the microbiome in human health. Here we assessed this hypothesis by using 10 independent studies and found that although there is an association, it is smaller than can be detected by most microbiome studies. Furthermore, we directly tested the ability to predict obesity status on the basis of the composition of an individual’s microbiome and found that the median classiﬁcation accuracy is between 33.01 and 64.77\%. This type of analysis can be used to design future studies and expanded to explore other hypotheses.},

We find that {IBD} has a consistent signature across studies and allows high classification accuracy of {IBD} from non-{IBD} subjects, but that although subjects can be classified as lean or obese within each individual study with statistically significant accuracy, consistent with the ability of the microbiota to experimentally transfer this phenotype, signatures of obesity are not consistent between studies even when the data are analyzed with consistent methods. The results suggest that correlations between microbes and clinical conditions with different effect sizes (e.g. the large effect size of {IBD} versus the small effect size of obesity) may require different cohort selection and analysis strategies.},

Although the authors note that both subtypes of {IBD}, particularly {CD}, have increased microbial community instability, this information is not used as a feature to improve classifier accuracy. Could microbiome instability become actionable by creating a new classifier that benefits from repeated measurements? If so, how many samples per individual are needed to assess instability?

The most abundant and well-studied microbiota are found in the gut, where the bacterial density reaches 1011–1012 cells/g in the distal human colon. The number of bacteria in the human gut has been estimated to exceed the number of somatic cells in the body by an order of magnitude and that the biomass of the gut microbiota may reach up to 1.5 kg.

    	abstract = {Background and aims Microbiota alterations are linked with colorectal cancer ({CRC}) and notably higher abundance of putative oral bacteria on colonic tumours. However, it is not known if colonic mucosa-associated taxa are indeed orally derived, if such cases are a distinct subset of patients or if the oral microbiome is generally suitable for screening for {CRC}.
    Methods We profiled the microbiota in oral swabs, colonic mucosae and stool from individuals with {CRC} (99 subjects), colorectal polyps (32) or controls (103).
    Results Several oral taxa were differentially abundant in {CRC} compared with controls, for example, Streptococcus and Prevotellas pp. A classification model of oral swab microbiota distinguished individuals with {CRC} or polyps from controls (sensitivity: 53\% ({CRC})/67\% (polyps); specificity: 96\%). Combining the data from faecal microbiota and oral swab microbiota increased the sensitivity of this model to 76\% ({CRC})/88\% (polyps). We detected similar bacterial networks in colonic microbiota and oral microbiota datasets comprising putative oral biofilm forming bacteria. While these taxa were more abundant in {CRC}, core networks between pathogenic, {CRC}-associated oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus, Parvimonas and Fusobacterium were also detected in healthy controls. High abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with the colonisation of colonic tissue with oral-like bacterial networks suggesting a protective role for certain microbiota types against {CRC}, possibly by conferring colonisation resistance to {CRC}-associated oral taxa and possibly mediated through habitual diet.
    Conclusion The heterogeneity of {CRC} may relate to microbiota types that either predispose or provide resistance to the disease, and profiling the oral microbiome may offer an alternative screen for detecting {CRC}.},

    	abstract = {Background Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease ({IBD}) is challenging to diagnose because of the non-specificity of symptoms; an unequivocal diagnosis can only be made using colonoscopy, which clinicians are reluctant to recommend for children. Diagnosis of pediatric {IBD} is therefore frequently delayed, leading to inappropriate treatment plans and poor outcomes. We investigated the use of 16S {rRNA} sequencing of fecal samples and new analytical methods to assess differences in the microbiota of children with {IBD} and other gastrointestinal disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings We applied synthetic learning in microbial ecology ({SLiME}) analysis to 16S sequencing data obtained from i) published surveys of microbiota diversity in {IBD} and ii) fecal samples from 91 children and young adults who were treated in the gastroenterology program of Children’s Hospital (Boston, {USA}). The developed method accurately distinguished control samples from those of patients with {IBD}; the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve ({AUC}) value was 0.83 (corresponding to 80.3\% sensitivity and 69.7\% specificity at a set threshold). The accuracy was maintained among data sets collected by different sampling and sequencing methods. The method identified taxa associated with disease states and distinguished patients with Crohn’s disease from those with ulcerative colitis with reasonable accuracy. The findings were validated using samples from an additional group of 68 patients; the validation test identified patients with {IBD} with an {AUC} value of 0.84 (e.g. 92\% sensitivity, 58.5\% specificity). Conclusions/Significance Microbiome-based diagnostics can distinguish pediatric patients with {IBD} from patients with similar symptoms. Although this test can not replace endoscopy and histological examination as diagnostic tools, classification based on microbial diversity is an effective complementary technique for {IBD} detection in pediatric patients.},

The mechanisms driving recurrent post-dieting obesity remain largely elusive. Here we identify an intestinal microbiome signature that persists after successful dieting of obese mice and contributes to faster weight regain and metabolic aberrations upon re-exposure to obesity-promoting conditions. Faecal transfer experiments show that the accelerated weight regain phenotype can be transmitted to germ-free mice. We develop a machine-learning algorithm that enables personalized microbiome-based prediction of the extent of post-dieting weight regain. Additionally, we find that the microbiome contributes to diminished post-dieting flavonoid levels and reduced energy expenditure, and demonstrate that flavonoid-based ‘post-biotic’ intervention ameliorates excessive secondary weight gain. Together, our data highlight a possible microbiome contribution to accelerated post-dieting weight regain, and suggest that microbiome-targeting approaches may help to diagnose and treat this common disorder.},

The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different supervised machine-learning models in predicting {CRC} in two independent eastern and western populations. The structures of intestinal microflora in feces in Chinese population (N = 141) were determined by 454 {FLX} pyrosequencing, and different supervised classifiers were employed to predict {CRC} based on fecal microbiota operational taxonomic unit ({OTUs}). As a result, Bayes Net and Random Forest displayed higher accuracies than other algorithms in both populations, although Bayes Net was found with a lower false negative rate than that of Random Forest. Gut microbiota-based prediction was more accurate than the standard fecal occult blood test ({FOBT}), and the combination of both approaches further improved the prediction accuracy. Moreover, when unclassified {OTUs} were used as input, the {BayesDMNB} text algorithm achieved higher accuracy in the Chinese population ({AUC}=0.994). Taken together, our results suggest that Bayes Net classification model combined with unclassified {OTUs} may present an accurate method for predicting {CRC} based on the compositions of gut microbiota.},

    	abstract = {Objective There is a need for an improved biomarker for colorectal cancer ({CRC}) and advanced adenoma. We evaluated faecal microbial markers for clinical use in detecting {CRC} and advanced adenoma.
    Design We measured relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Pa) and Parvimonas micra (Pm) by quantitative {PCR} in 309 subjects, including 104 patients with {CRC}, 103 patients with advanced adenoma and 102 controls. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers with respect to faecal immunochemical test ({FIT}), and validated the results in an independent cohort of 181 subjects.
    Results The abundance was higher for all three individual markers in patients with {CRC} than controls (p{\textless}0.001), and for marker Fn in patients with advanced adenoma than controls (p=0.022). The marker Fn, when combined with {FIT}, showed superior sensitivity (92.3\% vs 73.1\%, p{\textless}0.001) and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve ({AUC}) (0.95 vs 0.86, p{\textless}0.001) than stand-alone {FIT} in detecting {CRC} in the same patient cohort. This combined test also increased the sensitivity (38.6\% vs 15.5\%, p{\textless}0.001) and {AUC} (0.65 vs 0.57, p=0.007) for detecting advanced adenoma. The performance gain for both {CRC} and advanced adenoma was confirmed in the validation cohort (p=0.0014 and p=0.031, respectively).
    Conclusions This study identified marker Fn as a valuable marker to improve diagnostic performance of {FIT}, providing a complementary role to detect lesions missed by {FIT} alone. This simple approach may improve the clinical utility of the current {FIT}, and takes one step further towards a non-invasive, potentially more accurate and affordable diagnosis of advanced colorectal neoplasia.},

    	abstract = {Objective  To characterise the gut microbiome in subjects with and without polyps and evaluate the potential of the microbiome as a non-invasive biomarker to screen for risk of colorectal cancer ({CRC}). Design  Presurgery rectal swab, home collected stool, and sigmoid biopsy samples were obtained from 231 subjects undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. 16S {rRNA} analysis was performed on 552 samples (231 rectal swab, 183 stool, 138 biopsy) and operational taxonomic units ({OTU}) were identified using {UPARSE}. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify {OTUs} that were significantly different between subjects with and without polyps. These informative {OTUs} were then used to build classifiers to predict the presence of polyps using advanced machine learning models.
    Results  We obtained clinical data on 218 subjects (87 females, 131 males) of which 193 were White, 21 {AfricanAmerican}, and 4 Asian-American. Colonoscopy detected polyps in 56\% of subjects. Modelling of the non-invasive home stool samples resulted in a classification accuracy {\textgreater}75\% for Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models using informative {OTUs}. A naïve holdout analysis performed on home stool samples resulted in an average false negative rate of 11.5\% for the Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models, which was reduced to 5\% when the two models were combined.
    Conclusion  Gut microbiome analysis combined with advanced machine learning represents a promising approach to screen patients for the presence of polyps, with the potential to optimise the use of colonoscopy, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with {CRC}, and reduce associated healthcare costs.},

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems.

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in {DNA} sequencing technology have allowed the collection of high-dimensional data from human-associated microbial communities on an unprecedented scale. A major goal of these studies is the identification of important groups of microorganisms that vary according to physiological or disease states in the host, but the incidence of rare taxa and the large numbers of taxa observed make that goal difficult to obtain using traditional approaches. Fortunately, similar problems have been addressed by the machine learning community in other fields of study such as microarray analysis and text classification. In this review, we demonstrate that several existing supervised classifiers can be applied effectively to microbiota classification, both for selecting subsets of taxa that are highly discriminative of the type of community, and for building models that can accurately classify unlabeled data. To encourage the development of new approaches to supervised classification of microbiota, we discuss several structures inherent in microbial community data that may be available for exploitation in novel approaches, and we include as supplemental information several benchmark classification tasks for use by the community.},

 abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

	shorttitle = {Collinearity},
	abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional {GLM} and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of {GLM} in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ?folk lore?-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

The proposed method specifies the candidate prognostic gene module by graph learning using the generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) model, and scores genes using a {PageRank} algorithm. We applied the proposed method to multiple-omics data that included copy number, gene expression, {DNA} methylation, and somatic mutation data for five cancer types. The proposed method showed better prediction accuracy than did existing methods. We identified many prognostic genes and their roles in their biological pathways. We also showed that the genes identified from different omics data were complementary, which led to improved accuracy in prediction using multi-omics data.},

This paper will suggest a potential application of Deep Learning Algorithms for the analysis of large amounts of data produced by the research of the Human Microbiome. Humans have coevolved with microbes in the environment, and each body habitat has a unique set of microorganisms (microbiota). The most abundant and well-studied microbiota are found in the gut, where the bacterial density reaches 1011–1012 cells/g in the distal human colon. The number of bacteria in the human gut has been estimated to exceed the number of somatic cells in the body by an order of magnitude and that the biomass of the gut microbiota may reach up to 1.5 kg. This paper presents different methods that have been implemented and tested on a Human Microbiome Dataset. Besides the findings concerning accuracy and runtime, the results suggest that the Deep Learning algorithms could be successfully used to analyze large amounts of Microbiota data.},

	abstract = {Colonic bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of colorectal cancer with some protecting against inflammation and others exacerbating inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic bacteria that produce {SCFAs} by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an association between fecal {SCFA} concentrations and the presence of colonic adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S {rRNA} gene and metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no significant associations between {SCFA} concentration and tumor status. When we incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the ability of 16S {rRNA} gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to predict the concentration of each {SCFA} based on 16S {rRNA} gene or metagenomic gene sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able to explain at most 14\% of the observed variation in the {SCFA} concentrations. These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, fecal {SCFA} concentrations have limited predictive power.
{IMPORTANCE} Considering that colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids ({SCFAs}) are often used as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal {SCFA} concentrations of a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to find an association between {SCFA} concentration and tumor burden or use {SCFAs} to improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal community structure and {SCFA} concentrations. Our results indicate that the association between fecal {SCFAs}, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To assess the accuracy of a multitarget stool {DNA} test ({MT}-{sDNA}) compared with fecal immunochemical testing for hemoglobin ({FIT}) for detection of screening-relevant colorectal neoplasia ({SRN}) in Alaska Native people, who have among the world's highest rates of colorectal cancer ({CRC}) and limited access to conventional screening approaches.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed a prospective, cross-sectional study of asymptomatic Alaska Native adults aged 40-85 years and older undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy between February 6, 2012, and August 7,Â 2014.
{RESULTS}: Among 868 enrolled participants, 661 completed the study (403 [61\%] women). Overall, {SRN} detection by {MT}-{sDNA} (49\%) was superior to that by {FIT} (28\%; P{\textless}.001); in the screening group, {SRN} detection rates were 50\% and 31\%, respectively (P=.01). Multitarget stool {DNA} testing detected 62\% of adenomas 2 cm or larger vs 29\% by {FIT} (P=.05). Sensitivity by {MT}-{sDNA} increased with adenoma size (to 80\% for lesions â¥3 cm; P=.01 for trend) and substantially exceeded {FIT} sensitivity at all adenoma sizes. For sessile serrated polyps larger than 1 cm (n=9), detection was 67\% by {MT}-{sDNA} vs 11\% by {FIT} (P=.07). For {CRC} (n=10), detection was 100\% by {MT}-{sDNA} vs 80\% by {FIT} (P=.48). Specificities were 93\% and 96\%, respectively (P=.03).
{CONCLUSION}: The sensitivity of {MT}-{sDNA} for cancer and larger polyps was high and significantly greater than that of {FIT} for polyps of any size, while specificity was slightly higher with {FIT}. These findings could translate into high cumulative neoplasm detection rates on serial testing within a screening program. The {MT}-{sDNA} represents a potential strategy to expand {CRC} screening and reduce {CRC} incidence and mortality, especially where access to endoscopy is limited.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: In life sciences, interpretability of machine learning models is as important as their prediction accuracy. Linear models are probably the most frequently used methods for assessing feature relevance, despite their relative inflexibility. However, in the past years effective estimators of feature relevance have been derived for highly complex or non-parametric models such as support vector machines and RandomForest (RF) models. Recently, it has been observed that RF models are biased in such a way that categorical variables with a large number of categories are preferred.Results: In this work, we introduce a heuristic for normalizing feature importance measures that can correct the feature importance bias. The method is based on repeated permutations of the outcome vector for estimating the distribution of measured importance for each variable in a non-informative setting. The P-value of the observed importance provides a corrected measure of feature importance. We apply our method to simulated data and demonstrate that (i) non-informative predictors do not receive significant P-values, (ii) informative variables can successfully be recovered among non-informative variables and (iii) P-values computed with permutation importance (PIMP) are very helpful for deciding the significance of variables, and therefore improve model interpretability. Furthermore, PIMP was used to correct RF-based importance measures for two real-world case studies. We propose an improved RF model that uses the significant variables with respect to the PIMP measure and show that its prediction accuracy is superior to that of other existing models.Availability: R code for the method presented in this article is available at http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/∼altmann/download/PIMP.RContact:altmann@mpi-inf.mpg.de, laura.tolosi@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
