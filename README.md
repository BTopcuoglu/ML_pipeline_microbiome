Machine learning (ML) for classification of data into groups based on pre-determined criteria is being used to make decisions in healthcare, economics, criminal justice and more. However, implementing a robust ML classification pipeline can be time-consuming, confusing, and difficult. Here, we present mikRopML, an easy-to-use R package that acts as a wrapper around the R caret package and can be used for binary classification problems using logistic regression, random forest, and xgBoost.

mikRopML provides functions to facilitate the crucial steps of ML: pre-processing, cross-validation, testing, model evaluation, and model interpretation.
